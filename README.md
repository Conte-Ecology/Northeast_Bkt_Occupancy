## Abstract

Coming Soon

## Objectives

1. Evaluate landscape, land-use, and climate factors affecting the probability of Brook Trout occupancy in the eastern United States
2. Predict Brook Trout occupancy in each stream reach (confluence to confluence) across the region currently
3. Forecast Brook Trout occupancy under future conditions
4. Examine the tolerance  of Brook Trout to warming and forest change across space
5. Visualize climate mitigation potential through forest change

## Approach 

We used a logistic mixed effects model to include the effects of landscape, land-use, and climate variables on the probability of Brook Trout occupancy in stream reaches (confluence to confluence). We included random effects of HUC10 (watershed) to allow for the chance that the probability of occupancy and the effect of covariates were likely to be similar within a watershed. Our fish data came primarily from state and federal agencies (see below). We considered a stream occupied if any Brook Trout were ever caught during an electrofishing survey between 1991 and 2010.
